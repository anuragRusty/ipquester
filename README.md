# IP Quester

IP Quester is an educational, decision-based web game focused on creating intellectual property awareness among school students in a very engaging and visual way. This is achieved through interactive scenarios/stories (Game’s Level), modern pixel art illustrations, and animations, with retro sound effects. The interactive scenarios will have multiple endings depending on the player’s decisions, creating an immersive player experience and making learning more fun and dynamic.
